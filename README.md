# Index-mouse
Use your index controllers as a mouse. Currently only supports the use of the right controller since I am unsure if I wanna add shortcuts or other stuff to the left.

## Note:
Currently you need your VR headset to be plugged in, since I dont know how to spoof that in SteamVR, but its just a black image so there shouldnt be any problems with burn in.
